# Changelog

## v1

The first public release. Everything below is in it.

- **Three save slots**, each with its own delete button and confirmation, on the main menu.
- **Bug reporting**: F7, or a button in the pause menu and the main menu, opens a form with dropdowns for category, severity, frequency and location, and free text for what happened, what was expected and the steps. It gathers the game version, the system, the settings, where the player was standing, recent script errors, lifetime stats and, with permission, the savegame. It then fills in a GitHub issue that is labelled by area and severity and assigns the developer. An optional relay (`tools/report-relay`) files it directly for players without a GitHub account.
- `tools/decode-report.js` pulls a reporter's savegame back out of an issue so it can be loaded in a developer slot.
